Our goal is to work with you to recognize that achieving your health goals can be done with convenience.

We strive to solve the crisis of the lack of affordable and healthy food available in our greater community. Price should not be an obstacle for those who are eager to achieve their health goals. We strongly believe in equity through food.

Overview

Farmacy Family is an enhancement of the existing Farmacy Foods system (designed by Arch Colider from the first Kata exercise) that adds tighter engagement with their customers. The primary goals:

- develop relationships between engaged customers and nurture those relationships
- convert transactional customers to engaged customers
- generate analytical data from medical information to demonstrate the benefits of Farmacy Foods

When a transactional customer purchases a meal, Farmacy Family will generate an email elucidating additional benefits available for becoming an engaged customer.

Thus, the overall goal of Farmacy Family is to connect, gather, analyze, and communicate.

Users: Hundreds, separated by distinct geographic zones. Additionally, different clusters of customers frequently consolidate around similar dietary requirements. A focus on ensuring that entire offering is accommodating to low income, poverty, and homeless.

Requirements:

* Add a new system to manage customer profiles, allowing community engagement, personalization around preferences and dietary needs

* Support geographical trend analysis to hone Farmacy Family’s ability to optimize the foods delivered to fridges (an additional integration point TO Farmacy Foods)

* Support both push and pull models for community engagement. In other words, Farmacy Family will manage forums,emails, and create connections between similar demographics. Farmacy Family needs transactional member information for outreach purposes. The engagement model includes subscriptions, forums, reference material, class information, and other media that supports Food-as-medicine

* eDietian has access customer profile to improve advice and monitoring of customers. Additionally, the customer and dietitian can interact via messages.

* Farmacy Family wants to improve the distribution and potential food waste from having the wrong mix of foods in a particular fridge.

* Farmacy Family will include medical profile information and the ability to share information with medical service providers. 

* Farmacy Family customers can customize how much profile information they want to allow the community to see, at a fine-grained level.

* Farmacy Family has relationships with third party providers (clinics, doctors, etc) that have access to more analytical data to improve engagement (for example, regional dietary observations). 

* Add Farmacy Family user interface to existing Foods interface, which is currently a Reactive monolith. Create a holistic UX for both food and Farmacy Family to support engagement model.
