## Glossary

- Farmacy Foods (FFoods) - Order management system.
- Farmacy Family (FFamily) - The system, needs to be designed. It will extend functionality of FFoods.
- Transactional Customer - A customer, who makes purchase using FFoods service. He/She used just FFoods.
- Engaged Customer - Transactional Customer, registeered in FFamily aswell.
- Support Community - engaged members within a community.
- Client (Customer) - low income, poverty level, homeless, college students, educators, senior citizens.
- Community - small group of engaged customers within a neighborhood area
- Medcal Data Platform - an aggregation platform for EHRs from various EHR providers (e.g. [Nuna](https://www.nuna.com/))

## Overview

FFamily should add tighter engagement with their customers.

FFamily is an enhancement of the existing FFoods system deals with:
 - products catalog 
 - order management 
 - order shipping
 - payments
 - smart fridges management
 - etc.

 FFoods has been designed before, but not developed yet (we play in the "brown fields", and it's possible to submit requirements to FFoods).

 FFamily needs to be aware of seamless integration with FFoods.

## Business Case and Goals

The overall goal of FFamily is to connect, gather, analyze, and communicate.

Primary goals are:
- develop relationships between engaged customers and nurture those relationships;
- convert transactional customers to engaged customers;
- generate analytical data from medical information to demonstrate the benefits of FFoods;


Users: Hundreds, separated by distinct geographic zones.
Additionally, different clusters of customers frequently consolidate around similar dietary requirements.
Shouldfocus on ensuring that entire offering is accommodating to low income, poverty, and homeless.

FFamily should provide the Customer Relationship Management system (CRM) and Customer Data Profile system (CDP). Also it should provide the ability to get Data-Driven decisions and analytics.

The desired solution from the functional perspective:

![Marketecture](https://github.com/sakosy/arch_katas_2021/blob/main/Images/marketecture.png)

FFoods + FFamily will provide a way to create an infinity customer journey on both systems.
It should be possible to increase Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), FFoods income and get more investors based on better analytics.

## Constraints

| # | Description |
|----|----|
| CNS-1 | Add Farmacy Family user interface to existing Foods interface, which is currently a Reactive monolith. Create a holistic UX for both food and Farmacy Family to support engagement model |
| CNS-2 | Farmacy Foods is a startup, so it will not be able to spend a lot of money for the development |
| CNS-3 | Some data can be considered as information about any ongoing or chronic conditions, so Farmacy Foods complies the HIPAA [Security rule](https://www.asha.org/practice/reimbursement/hipaa/hitech-act/) |


## Assumptions

| # | Description |
|----|----|

| ASM-2 | kitchens (3rd party included) wants to send updates about fridges refillment and Farmacy Food support it |
| ASM-3 | Food suppliers wants to send updates about fridges refillment and Farmacy Food support it |
| ASM-4 | Support Community includes all _Communities_ of Farmacy Family Customers |
| ASM-5 | Community includes customers in some concrete neighborhood |
| ASM-6 | Community may includes customers with same diet |
| ASM-7 | Dietitians will guides classes and any other education |

### Architecture Characteristics Requirements
- **Scalability:** We should care about potential growth of analytical data and communication history volume (FR-5, FR-8, FR-9).
- **Security:** We have to operate with customer's private medical profiles. So, this type of data must be processed securely (FR-10, FR-13).
- **Domain partitioning:** We need to build independent domain areas by requirements: onboarding, community, integration. Each of them can be implemented independently (FR-5, FR-8, FR-9, FR-10).
- **Elasticity:** The engagement could increase a number of customers drastically, so we should be able to start from just dozens of users and process up to thousands without any lacks. This follows from the system goals.
