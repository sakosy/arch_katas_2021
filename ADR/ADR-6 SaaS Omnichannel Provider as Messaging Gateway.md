# Use SaaS Omnichannel Provider as Messaging Gateway

## Context
Farmacy Family functionality requires a lot of communications with Engaged Customers. In modern world we have sms, email, facebook, messangers, applications etc.
Customer may prefer different channels of communications with different scenarios or limitations (contact policy).

## Decision
As Farmacy Family is a startup, we won't to make investments into communications when we can take this functionality by SaaS model from the cloud platforms.

## Consequences
This will complicate the exchange of data between modules, but will avoid data leakage.
